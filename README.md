FarVault helps people easily store their Bitcoin in an extremely secure way.

Let's compare Bitcoin storage to gold storage. You can have gold virtually in a broker's account or you can have it physically.

Holding physical gold is the best option as it avoids a number of hassles and risks such as having your account seized or frozen, hacks, broker breach, escrow fees, having to share your personal details, the bureaucratic hell of inheritance, etc.

However, having physical gold also comes with a number of problems as, at the end of the day, it is a metal that is not easily divisible, difficult to move across borders, heavy and needs to be stored in an extremely secure location.

Bitcoin is digital gold. It doesn't come with the hassles associated with being a physical item sint it's easily divisible and easy to move. But you must keep your keys (your passwords for the Bitcoin system) extremely secure. This is somewhat similar to gold. So let's explore what Gold Bugs have been up to over the last five thousand years.

You can think as if you store physical gold in a safe deposit box. A safe deposit box is an individually stored container held within a high secure safe or vault which is only accessible to the key holder.
This is better than storing gold at home but if you loose the key you are done.

These If you have never  that anyone can access can go there and open the deposit box.

a) Protect your Bitcoin with one master key.

This is similar to storing gold in a Vault that can be opened with a key. If someone finds the key then they can steal your gold.
This is the most common way to store Bitcoin. It is not bad if good measures are taken.

b) You can have a Vault that can only be opened with a couple of keys. This is called the "two-man rule" mechanism. This mechanis requires the presence of two or more authorized people at all times. It's often used to store large quantities of gold or paper money and also to protect nuclear weapons lunch systems.

Bitcoin has something similar called multi-sig.

So we first need a way to materialize the keys. First of all, tt's extremelly important that you choose your own keys. Never, absolutelly never, accept a key fabricated by a third party.
